Solutions to the tasks of Go2IT Boot Camp - Week 5

# Task5_1 Desription:

Create a class structure that will reflect different types of shoes.
▪ Remember that a child extends parent
▪ Try to distinguish some unique properties of each particular type of shoes
▪ Methods are not required

# Task5_2 Description: 

Create an hierarchy of Java classes to represent figure below:
▪ Triangle
▪ Circle
▪ Square
▪ Rectangle
▪ Trapezium
You need to extract common properties only (methods not required).

# Task5_3 Description: 

Create hierarchy/hierarchies of Java classes to represent different animal species:
▪ Dolphin
▪ Cat
▪ Snail
▪ Human
▪ Sparrow
Hierarchy can be complex – Animal -> Bird -> Sparrow (even though Bird will have only one children).
Create classes that will:
1. Have corresponding common properties (ie brain, parts of body etc).
2. Have methods that will be inherited from the parent class based on hierarchy (ie Bird.fly() -> Sparrow.fly() etc).
3. Create methods that will be overridden in the children classes (ie Mammal -> Dolphin.drinkMilk(), dolphin will drink milk underwater etc).
4. Create instances of each Animal.
